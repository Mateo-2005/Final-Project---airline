### 🎯 General and Specific Objectives

*🌐 General Objective*
Develop an automated and secure system to efficiently manage "AEROSKY" flights, enhancing user experience and optimizing key processes such as flight reservation and management.

*🔍 Specific Objectives*
1. Implement an automated system that simplifies processes (such as reservation, flight management, administration, etc.), thereby increasing efficiency for AEROSKY.
2. Provide an efficient, visually appealing, and user-friendly platform for users.
3. Ensure the security of all user-provided data and the reliability of the system.


### 🛠️ Components 
- User Interface: Offers an accessible and friendly experience, requiring authentication to ensure data privacy.
- Database: PHP Admin is used to manage the database, storing information such as flight details and passenger data.

## 🧩 Methodology: Agile Development Approach

- Iterative Development: Adopt an iterative approach to continuously refine and enhance the system based on feedback and changing requirements.
- Sprints: Divide the project into sprints of 2-4 weeks each, focusing on specific functionalities or modules to develop, test, and integrate into the system.
- Daily Stand-ups: Conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plan for the day's tasks, ensuring transparency and alignment among team members.
- User Stories: Define user stories to capture functional requirements from the perspective of end-users, ensuring that each sprint delivers tangible value to stakeholders.
- Continuous Integration and Deployment: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, build, and deployment processes, ensuring a stable and reliable system at all times.
- Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders and end-users to gather insights and validate assumptions, allowing for adjustments and improvements throughout development.
- Quality Assurance: Implement rigorous testing protocols, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT), to ensure the system meets quality standards and user expectations.
- Scalability and Flexibility: Design the system with scalability and flexibility in mind to accommodate future growth, technological advancements, and changing business needs.

## ⚙ Functional and Non-Functional Elements of the Project

### 🛠 Functional Elements

Results 📈
- Automation of important processes such as flight management and reservations.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users (customers) to search for flights, select seats, and make reservations.
- Instant confirmation of reservations with options for management and cancellation, aiming for customer satisfaction.

## 📌 Conclusions

- Optimization and automation of processes reduce daily management of flights and reservations, enabling AEROSKY to operate efficiently.
- Implementation of an intuitive interface with clear options enhances AEROSKY's reputation and customer satisfaction.
- The system complies with industry regulations and security standards, maintaining all user information in complete confidentiality.

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Implement a monitoring process for the system to detect and resolve potential issues or make improvements.
- Train staff on the effective use of the system to provide efficient technical support.
- Plan for future system expansion concerning the number of flights and users.
- Gradually collect feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
