## 🧩 Methodology: Agile Development Approach

- Iterative Development: Adopt an iterative approach to continuously refine and enhance the system based on feedback and changing requirements.
- Sprints: Divide the project into sprints of 2-4 weeks each, focusing on specific functionalities or modules to develop, test, and integrate into the system.
- Daily Stand-ups: Conduct daily stand-up meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and plan for the day's tasks, ensuring transparency and alignment among team members.
- User Stories: Define user stories to capture functional requirements from the perspective of end-users, ensuring that each sprint delivers tangible value to stakeholders.
- Continuous Integration and Deployment: Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, build, and deployment processes, ensuring a stable and reliable system at all times.
- Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop with stakeholders and end-users to gather insights and validate assumptions, allowing for adjustments and improvements throughout development.
- Quality Assurance: Implement rigorous testing protocols, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing (UAT), to ensure the system meets quality standards and user expectations.
- Scalability and Flexibility: Design the system with scalability and flexibility in mind to accommodate future growth, technological advancements, and changing business needs.
