## ⚙ Functional and Non-Functional Elements of the Project

### 🛠 Functional Elements

Results 📈
- Automation of important processes such as flight management and reservations.
- Intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users (customers) to search for flights, select seats, and make reservations.
- Instant confirmation of reservations with options for management and cancellation, aiming for customer satisfaction.

## 📌 Conclusions

- Optimization and automation of processes reduce daily management of flights and reservations, enabling AEROSKY to operate efficiently.
- Implementation of an intuitive interface with clear options enhances AEROSKY's reputation and customer satisfaction.
- The system complies with industry regulations and security standards, maintaining all user information in complete confidentiality.

## 🚀 Recommendations
- Implement a monitoring process for the system to detect and resolve potential issues or make improvements.
- Train staff on the effective use of the system to provide efficient technical support.
- Plan for future system expansion concerning the number of flights and users.
- Gradually collect feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
